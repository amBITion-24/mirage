Respected Recipient ,

I hope this message finds you well. As part of my work on Augmented Reality, the assets we use often exceed 100 MB in size. Unfortunately, due to GitHub's 25 MB upload restriction, I am unable to upload the human organ asset I created directly to the repository.

To facilitate my submission, I have provided a google drive  link to the complete project file. This comprehensive package includes:

- The assets we made
- Recordings of the assets
- Recorded functioning of the product
- The code for the website
- The code for the app

You can access the complete project file using the following link:   [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GR0xdC7Qp_FfXvBg_zGcZeXZkb3F_L9y?usp=drive_link]

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,  
Aryaman Deepak Desai
